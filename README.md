### Pre-requisites
<h2></h2>

To run these scripts, you will need Python installed on your PC. Please visit [Python Installers](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version of Python. 


Alternatively, if you just want to play around with the application without installing Python, you can use the provided Docker image. This allows you to run the application in a containerized environment.

#### Option 1: Running Locally with Python
1. Install Python.
2. Other requirements can be installed using `requirements.txt`.

#### Option 2: Running with Docker
1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
2. Pull the Docker image using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker pull vihar2712/ncsu-campus-jobs:latest
   ```
3. Run the Docker container:
  ```docker run -it -p 5000:5000 -e EMAIL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here -e EMAIL_ADDRESS=sender_email vihar2712/ncsu-campus-jobs:latest```
4. Access the application at ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/```

<h2></h2>
Initially you can check whether your system has python pre-installed or not, usually nowadays in most of the systems, be it Windows or MacOS, python is pre-installed. 

To check whether you have python installed or not, you can open CMD or a Terminal and run the command "python --version". If the CMD shows the version such as Python 3.6.7 then your system already has python installed and you just need to clone the repository and run the python scripts. 

If this is not the case, then you need to download python installer package from [Python Installers](https://www.python.org/downloads/) based on your system's operating system and install it and you can further clone this repository to execute the scripts.

You can refer [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/fantastic-riddles/NCSU_Campus_Jobs_Review_System_2.0/blob/feature/readme-badges/INSTALL.md) for the complete installation steps based on your OS.

### Docker setup  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Docker_logo.png" alt="Docker Logo" width="90"/>
<h2></h2>

1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
2. [Steps to Build and Run the Application](#steps-to-build-and-run-the-application)
   - [Clone the Repository](#clone-the-repository)
   - [Build the Docker Image](#build-the-docker-image)
   - [Run the Docker Container](#run-the-docker-container)
   - [Access the Application](#access-the-application)
3. [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
4. [Additional Resources](#additional-resources)

#### Prerequisites

1. **Install Docker**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. **Docker Hub Account**: Optional, but useful if you want to push your Docker images to a repository.

#### Steps to Build and Run the Application

##### Clone the Repository

If you haven’t already, clone the application repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fantastic-riddles/NCSU_Campus_Jobs_Review_System_2.0.git
cd NCSU_Campus_Jobs_Review_System_2.0
```

##### Build the Docker Image

Use the following command to build the Docker image. Replace `ncsu-campus-jobs` with the desired image name.

```bash
docker build -t ncsu-campus-jobs .
```

##### Run the Docker Container

To run the application, you need to provide your email API key and email address as environment variables. Replace `your_api_key_here` and `sender_email` with your actual credentials. your `your_api_key_here` is the key you created using Sendgrid.

```bash
docker run -it -p 5000:5000 -e EMAIL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here -e EMAIL_ADDRESS=sender_email ncsu-campus-jobs
```

##### Access the Application

Once the container is running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Docker Not Running**: Ensure that Docker Desktop (or your Docker service) is running on your machine.
- **Port Conflicts**: If port 5000 is already in use, you can change the port mapping in the `docker run` command (e.g., `-p 8080:5000`).
- **Logs**: If the application fails to start, check the logs for any error messages. You can view logs with the following command:

  ```bash
  docker logs <container-id>
  ```

- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
